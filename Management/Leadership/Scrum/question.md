# Scrum Question

[ASK] 24. Address bug debt in the following sprint
To maintain commitment consistency and stable work rhythm, all bugs found during a current sprint must be resolved in the following sprint. Don’t try to squeeze the fixes into a current sprint, unless they don’t break the initial commitment. This will make your sprint planning more precise and all tracking predictable.

[ASK] 8. Plan new sprint when product backlog has enough items
Sprint planning must happen only once the product backlog has enough items for at least two sprints. Otherwise, the project could suffer from a scope creep, an uncontrolled growth in a project scope because the scope for the nearest sprints wasn’t fully defined in the product backlog.
=> epic should be more specific on story
