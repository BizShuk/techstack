# PI

Business Requirement
-> Epic
-> Story break down
-> Technique break down
-> Preparing/Assigning for next 3-4 sprints

## PI Planning

1. Leadership, Leadership
2. Product Manager, Business Owner and Product Owner : features creating and prioritize
3. Product Owner, Scrum Master : create user stories
4. Dev Teams, Scrum Master : give story points and create objective/catagory based on stories
5. Scrum Masters, Leadership : complete PI spreadsheet
6. All, Leadership : readouts

### Talking Points

- Have you entered all PTO or Maintenance days?
- Has your velocity changed since last increment?
- Have any of your iterations overreached their capacity?
- Are you working on the highest priority Epics/Features from the Product Manager? If not, what is the reason?
- Waht are the risks/dependencies to the planned stories, and do you know when those dependencies are planned for completion?
- What teams are dependent on your stories, and do you know if they planned appropriately compared to when you'll complete your work?
- Have all user stories been linked to an epic?
- Have all user stories been assigned to a sprint (the comon sprints)?
- Are all user stories, spikes and bugs pointed?

## PI naming

It's a fun part. Given a conceptual idea and submit by team member. ex: From Greek myth

### Greek Myth

- Daedalus
- Eros

## Meetings

### PI Preview

Time: should be  one week before PI Planning  
Attendee: Product Manager, Product Owner

Wish to has priority between EPIC  
Try to choose at least one epic and few backups which will be decided during PI Planning

### PI Planning

Time: Middle of last PI Sprint 4  

Attendee: Team leaders, Product Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Program Manager

Go through EPICs and break down EPICs to stories

### PI Readout

Time: 1 ~ 3 days after PI Planning  
Attendee: Team Leaders, Product Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Program Manager

Puting break-down stories into 4 sprints in next PI and filling PI spreadsheet

## Issue

When PI planning is hosted and PM is showing epics around, no one have ideas about who goona get certain epic. Specially for offshore team, it's quite hard to identify what they want whether it overlap with other onshore team. evne with priority on those epics.
