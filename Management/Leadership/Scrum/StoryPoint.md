# Story Point

## Idea from Ben

1 p/day
24p for one PI - 3 holiday => Recommand 18.9p

## From mine

This is under some hard restriction, like computor resource. Here rough analogy, developing modern software on 15yrs ago computor.

### Definition

- 1p => Knowing where and what to do exactly, few lines change without logic condition
- 2p => Knowing which function to change,
- 3p => Simple api requirement, getList. Or, multiple functions changes.
- 5p => Create a whole new api. Wrap SDK.
- 8p => Involve multiple api changes.
- 13p=> Involve multiple components/applicaitoins/services

### Time frame and uncertainty

- 1p => 4hr +- 1hr
- 2p => 1d +- 2~4hr
- 3p => 2~3d +- 1~2d
- 5p => 1w +- 2~3d
- 8p => 2w(1sprint) +- 1w
- 13p=> 4-8w(1~2m)(1~3sprint) +- 2~4w
