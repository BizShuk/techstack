By dividing orignal team into two equally, it can provider effective/effeciacy of onboarding process of newbies.

## propose sample

Having more vertical sliced work items from next PI, team here has good chance to separate into two cross-functional teams. Propose to add 1 PM, and 5 developers. With the coordination from PM, Taipei teams became two self-contained scrum teams that work directly with Taipei PM. We have four agile developers released from the SCPE, they are currently available to start the work. There will be a Junior engineer to be hired after we bring the four SCPE developers in. Considered their specialties and the work preference, Iâ€™d propose to have below team structure for ramp up the team dynamics and the work pace.
