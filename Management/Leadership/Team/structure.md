# Team Structure

Scope-1 is minimum team size, and incremental in hierarchy

Best case principles:

- equaling seniors as well as junior
- keep engineers can have comprehensive pictures of features
- keep engineers are not bothered by meetings
- only one persion for intercommunication (Not necessary be certain one, but should know things inside the team)
