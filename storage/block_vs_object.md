# Storage Block vs Object

[Block storage] is like a segment of data. With some metadata, it can assemble into one big truck of data. So, it has great performance(high speed, low latency) compared to other solutions. Even though, some factors can influence by where the data stored.

suitable for: DB storage, VM truck, container volume, RAID, application data

[Object storage] is flat structure for large, unstructured data.

[File storage] is similiar to Object storage but with hierachy.
