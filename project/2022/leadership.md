# Leadership in TSMC

It was a start-up team for adoptiong of DevOps methodology in AL/ML process. And TSMC is traditional manifacture company. The culture is different than the modern software company. Hierachy report is not flat structure in org, is what it is showing. The manager is more like a release manager instead of engineer manager or people manager.

It was a time that no enough sernior engineer to contribute design and thoughts. I was in charged of giving team's direction, architecture, and planning of phases and milestones. It is from zero to multiple area, [kubernetes], [service mesh with istio], [Kong API Gateway], [NATS], Monitoring [Promethus] [Grafana] [EFK], [Nodejs] services, [Protocal] intergration... etc. And also I need to claim the statement in each month publicly in the deparment.

In some cases, if a enterprise solution doesn't fit in our plan, I go for discussion with other deparment as well.
