# Leadership Task Convincing

Most of people would like to work on impactful tasks. However, there is no such many significant works for all of people. As a manager, you have to convince people to take those tasks. What I do is tell what those tasks helps on the growth of their roles. For example, a maintanence task is a task helping people get familiar with what code base is right now. Once the person do well, the team entrust him/her to do more divergent/disparate updates later for upcoming features. And for those new feature/architectures, obviously, it will add new skills to people who handles it.

[Pattern]: [Leadership] Try to perspectives of task to inspire interest of members.
