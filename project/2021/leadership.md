In first place, I was Sr. engineer. I did stories/tasks. On top of it, I apply more desigin pattern to achieve more flexibility/scalability in projects. For example, [AWS Lambda framework for Java], [AWS Secret Manager SpringBoot plugin],

After I got promoted to Tech Lead. My responsibility was changed.
I started to clarify details with PM, scope and size proper tasks for members. It requires know your members well, otherwise, it will overwhelm your member and they will fail you too. The overall department adopt Scrum methodology. There is always [Program Increment(PI) planning] every sprint 4th. It includes [Epic Review] by Tech Lead, 2 days [Epic Breakdown], one session ???).
